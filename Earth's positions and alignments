##In the field of historical geography, tracking the shifts in Earth's positions and alignments over time is crucial for understanding long-term climatic, geological, and astronomical phenomena.
##Your task is to develop a program that identifies specific years within a given range where all geographic positions on Earth have completely shifted after 60 years.

<---code--->
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int start,end,year;
    cin>>start;
    cin>>end;
    year = 0;
    for(int i =  start;i< end; i = i+60)
    {
        year = i;
        cout<<"All positions change in year "<<year<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
